# Product-Recommendation-System-Using-Machine-Learning

This project tackles the challenge of building a personalized PRS leveraging the power of machine learning.
The system analyzes data about users and products to identify patterns and relationships, enabling it to predict which products each user is likely to find appealing.

**Machine Learning Techniques:**
This implementation primarily focuses on two primary machine learning approaches for building the recommendation engine

**Collaborative Filtering (CF)**:
CF methods rely on the wisdom of the crowd to make recommendations. They analyze user-item interactions (e.g., ratings, purchases, views) to identify users with similar preferences and recommend items that these similar users have enjoyed.
Two common CF approaches are employed:
User-based CF: This method finds users with similar tastes to the target user and recommends items that these similar users have interacted with.
Item-based CF: This method finds items similar to items the target user has interacted with and recommends these similar items.

**Content-based Filtering (CBF):**
CBF methods focus on analyzing the features and characteristics of both users and products to make recommendations. 
It builds a profile for each user based on their past actions and interests, and then recommends items that share similar attributes with items the user has previously interacted with.

**Data Preprocessing and Exploration**:
The system starts by acquiring a suitable dataset containing user-item interaction data. 
This could include information like user IDs, product IDs, ratings, purchase history, browsing behavior, demographics, and product descriptions.
The data undergoes rigorous preprocessing to clean, transform, and handle missing values, ensuring it's suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to gain insights into the data's distribution, patterns, and relationships between features.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**
Machine learning models are trained using the preprocessed data. 
The choice of models can be tailored based on various factors, including the nature of the data, the desired recommendations (e.g., top-k items, personalized rankings), and computational resources.

**Deployment and Integration:**
The chosen model is integrated with the target application environment e.g., web app to deliver personalized recommendations to users in real-time.
